## Latest Updates - v0.4.x

**Recurrent Layers (RNN) (0.4.1)**

Recurrent layers **(Simple RNN, GRU, LSTM)** are implemented in version 0.4.1. Support `statful` and `return_sequence` options. 

**New Structured Interface (0.4.0)** 

NNoM has provided a new layer interface called **Structured Interface**, all marked with `_s` suffix. which aims to use one C-structure to provided all the configuration for a layer. Different from the Layer API which is human friendly, this structured API are more machine friendly. 

**Per-Channel Quantisation (0.4.0)**

The new structred API supports per-channel quantisation (per-axis) and dilations for **Convolutional layers**. 

**New Scripts (0.4.0)**

From 0.4.0, NNoM will switch to structured interface as default to generate the model header `weights.h`. The scripts corresponding to structured interfaces are `nnom.py` while the Layer Interface corresponding to `nnom_utils.py`.

## Why NNoM?
The aims of NNoM is to provide a light-weight, user-friendly and flexible interface for fast deploying on MCU.

Nowadays, neural networks are **wider**, **deeper**, and **denser**.

After 2014, the development of Neural Networks are more focus on structure optimising to improve efficiency and performance, which is more important to the small footprint platforms such as MCUs. 
However, the available NN libs for MCU are too low-level which make it sooooo difficult to use with these complex strucures. 

Therefore, we build NNoM to help embedded developers for faster and simpler deploying NN model directly to MCU. 
> NNoM will manage the strucutre, memory and everything else for the developer. All you need to do is feeding your new measurements and getting the results. 

## Installing

NNoM can be installed as a Python package

```
pip install git+https://github.com/majianjia/nnom@master
```

NNoM requires [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) version `<= 2.14`.
There are multiple options for how to install this, see the TensorFlow documentation.

For example:
```
pip install 'tensorflow-cpu<=2.14.1'
```

NOTE: Tensorflow 2.14 supports up until Python 3.11.
However, *Python 3.12 is not supported*.

## Accessing C files

The C headers and source code in NNoM are distributed in the `nnom_core` Python package.
You can find its location by running the following command.
```
python -c "import nnom_core; print(nnom_core.__path__[0])"
```
In your build system, add the `inc/` and `port/` directories as include directories,
and compile the the `src/*.c` files.

## Performance 

There are many articles compared NNoM with other famous MCU AI tools, such as TensorFlow LiteSTM32Cube.AI .etc. 

**Raphael Zingg etc** from Zurich University of Applied Sciences compare nnom with tflite, cube, and e-Ai in their paper  ["Artificial Intelligence on Microcontrollers"](https://github.com/InES-HPMM/Artificial_Intelligence_on_Microcontrollers/blob/master/Artificial_Intelligence_on_Microcontrollers.pdf) blog https://blog.zhaw.ch/high-performance/2020/05/14/artificial-intelligence-on-microcontrollers/

![performance-comparison-tflite-cubeai-eai](docs/figures/performance-comparison-tflite-cubeai-eai.png)

**Butt Usman Ali** from POLITECNICO DI TORINO, did below comparison in [the thesis: On the deployment of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in low 
cost embedded systems](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/19692/1/tesi.pdf)

![performance-comparison-tflite-cubeai](docs/figures/performance-comparison-tflite-cubeai.png)

Both articles shows that NNoM is not only comparable with other popular NN framework but with faster inference time and sometime less memory footprint.

**Activations**

Activation can be used by itself as layer, or can be attached to the previous layer as ["actail"](docs/A_Temporary_Guide_to_NNoM.md#addictionlly-activation-apis) to reduce memory cost.

There is no structred API for activation currently, since activation are not usually used as a layer.

## Dependencies

NNoM now use the local pure C backend implementation by default. Thus, there is no special dependency needed. 

However, You will need to enable `libc` for dynamic memory allocation `malloc(), free(), and memset()`. Or you can port to the equivalent memory method in your system.  


## Optimization
[CMSIS-NN/DSP](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/tree/develop/CMSIS/NN) is an optimized backend for ARM-Cortex-M4/7/33/35P. You can select it for up to 5x performance compared to the default C backend. NNoM will use the equivalent method in CMSIS-NN if the condition met. 

Please check [Porting and optimising Guide](docs/Porting_and_Optimisation_Guide.md) for detail. 

## Known Issues
### The Converter do not support implicitly defined activations
The script currently does not support implicit act:
~~~
x = Dense(32, activation="relu")(x)
~~~
Use the explicit activation instead. 
~~~
x = Dense(32)(x)
x = Relu()(x)
~~~

## Tips - improving accuracy
- Attaching an BatchNormalization after each convolutional layer limit the activation range thus help quantisation. BN add no extra computation in NNoM. 
- Dont train too much epoch. Large epoch number increases extreme number in activation -> lower the quantisation resolution.
- Leave enough data for bottleneck - do not compress data at before the output of a model, infomation will be lost when it is quantised.
